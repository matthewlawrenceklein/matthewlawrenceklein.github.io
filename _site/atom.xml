   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-starting-point&quot;&gt;A Starting Point&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m alone in saying that my first foray into software development began when I had an idea for an app that I wanted bad enough
that when I couldn’t find it, I decided to try and learn how to make it myself. A few months later I’ve learned enough to know that I know
precious little, but I finally feel like I’m on a path where I can see the &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt; at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to use these blog posts as an opportunity to chronicle the process of developing an app &lt;em&gt;alongside&lt;/em&gt; developing a skillset. Let’s go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chompr---or-idk-what-do-you-feel-like&quot;&gt;chompr - Or, “IDK, what do you feel like?”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; too many nights laying on the couch with a friend or partner doing the back-and-forth dance of “what are you in the mood to eat”. It’s a vicious cycle of hunger, indecision, and ultimately, the resignation of eventually landing on a choice that no one’s particularly excited for. Literally any alternative would be prefarable: a giant plinko board, prize wheel, or even… an &lt;strong&gt;app&lt;/strong&gt;. Ideally an app that can help its users choose a meal option&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://external-preview.redd.it/zC3dcSZFa0BOSk-AbVIqN3vwy7lIKwKnlzs5DGpAz5E.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2cb4f9c634b5a431978867eeaa765887f4b4bab8&quot; alt=&quot;spin the choice&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;easily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;quickly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;intuitively&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fairly, with respect to each chooser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://rciemecdn.imgix.net/API/Blog/tapas_800px.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lots of food&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’ve put together a &lt;em&gt;wish list&lt;/em&gt; of features/functionality that I’d like to pursue, with varying degrees of complexity. Of course, it’s all pretty complex for me right now, but I’m attemping to tackle it in small chunks. For functionality, I’m hoping to build out an app that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accepts a geographic location (user-input zipcode? cellular location data? Google web location data?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;allows for either delivery or take-out&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accepts a number of choosers, with names for each (I think the process starts to break down with 5+ choosers)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provides the choosers with a randomized set of eight food categories (ie Thai, Korean, BBQ, Pub Fare)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;randomly selects a chooser to select a category to eliminate, within a time limit (30 second?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once choosers have eliminated all but one option, the app instantiates a search for nearby restaurants in that category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some stretch goals too, including user auth and API integration (grubhub? uber eats?). And any mobile development is firmly in the stretch category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;humble-beginnings---lets-write-some-code&quot;&gt;Humble Beginnings - Let’s write some code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got a couple of big ol’ lists of stuff I don’t know how to do yet up there, but I can start by building some base functionality. First, let’s figure out a way to randomly generate eight food categories from a much larger “database” of catagories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;def create_choices
    options = %w[Thai Sushi Japanese Southern Korean Greek Armenian Italian Pizza Burgers 
    Sandwiches BBQ Mexican American Fast-Food Diner Chinese Pub-Fare]
    
    mixed = options.shuffle
    
    $choice_set = []

    (0...8).map { |i| $choice_set.push(mixed[i]) }
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, so now we’ve got the ability to grab a new and randomized choice set every time. Now we should try and grab the number of chompers, and allow for naming each of them. Again, we’ll probably want to keep the max chompers to 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;def get_users
        print &amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;
        $users = $stdin.gets.chomp 

        case 
        when $users.to_i &amp;lt;= 4
            puts &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; * 15
            puts &amp;quot;super&amp;quot;
        when $users.to_i &amp;gt; 4
            puts &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; * 15
            puts &amp;quot;too many folx&amp;quot;
            get_users()
        else
            puts &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; * 15
            puts &amp;quot;invalid input&amp;quot;
            get_users()
        end
        puts &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; * 15
    end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let’s get names for each chomper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;def name_users

        $user_array = []
        i = 0
    
        while i &amp;lt; $users.to_i do
            print &amp;quot;user #{i + 1} name &amp;gt; &amp;quot;
            $user_array[i] = $stdin.gets.chomp
            i += 1
        end

``
        puts &amp;quot;super, we&amp;#39;ve got&amp;quot;
        puts &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; * 15
        puts $user_array
        puts &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; * 15
    end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s layout the logic for each elimination round. We want to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;randomly select a chomper to make a selection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;show the chomper the current food options&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take input for the option they’d like to eliminate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;remove the option from the options set&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;repeat until one option remains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve got so far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;def elimination_round
    
        while $choice_set.length &amp;gt; 1
            shuffled_users = $user_array.shuffle()
            puts &amp;quot;#{shuffled_users[0]}, you&amp;#39;ve been selected to eliminate an option&amp;quot;
            puts &amp;quot;what would you like to eliminate?&amp;quot;
            print &amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;quot;
            eliminate = $stdin.gets.chomp

            $choice_set.each do |name|
                if name == eliminate
                    $choice_set.delete(name)
                end
            end

            puts &amp;quot;your options are now&amp;quot;
            puts &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; * 15
            puts $choice_set
            puts &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; * 15
        end
    end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excellent! Now we’re making progress!
&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/40F4fLvOkInEk/giphy.gif&quot; alt=&quot;happy racoon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coming-up-next&quot;&gt;Coming Up Next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve not got the basic logic functioning, and we’re set to take user input from the command line. My next step is going to be packaging this functionality into a 
CLI ruby gem, and &lt;em&gt;shipping&lt;/em&gt; a first &lt;em&gt;completed&lt;/em&gt; product - so to speak. C’yall in a few weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This opera’s as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can’t just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. How much did you make me? I love this planet! I’ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This opera’s as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can’t just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you, buddy!
Moving along… Hi, I’m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Look, last night was a mistake. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Oh Leela! You’re the only person I could turn to; you’re the only person who ever loved me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, we’ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we’ll go ride the bumper cars.
It’s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
You know, I was God once.
Why did you bring us here?
Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Good man. Nixon’s pro-war and pro-family. When the lights go out, it’s nobody’s business what goes on between two consenting adults. Do a flip! I’m Santa Claus! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought “Why should I?” Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No argument here.
Negative, bossy meat creature!
When will that be?
Stop it, stop it. It’s fine. I will ‘destroy’ you! I’m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn’t alive to see this day. I haven’t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large bet on myself in round one. Shut up and take my money! I wish! It’s a nickel. When will that be? You guys aren’t Santa! You’re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? And remember, don’t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don’t not do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, I’m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Just once I’d like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn’t bound and gagged. I suppose I could part with ‘one’ and still be feared…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Why not indeed! I love you, buddy! You’re going back for the Countess, aren’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That could be ‘my’ beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Also Zoidberg. You guys go on without me! I’m going to go… look for more stuff to steal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, it’s 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can’t hold the charge and the reception isn’t very… When will that be? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ‘Earth in the Balance’’, and the much more popular ‘‘Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth’, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. You can see how I lived before I met you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, we’ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we’ll go ride the bumper cars. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. I’ll get my kit! And I’m his friend Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I’da done better, but it’s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Bender?! You stole the atom. Now what? Now Fry, it’s been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have all the Slurm you can drink when you’re partying with Slurms McKenzie! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. You guys go on without me! I’m going to go… look for more stuff to steal!&lt;/p&gt;
