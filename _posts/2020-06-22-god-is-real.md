This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!
We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. How much did you make me? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!

I love you, buddy!
Moving along… Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Look, last night was a mistake. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.
It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
You know, I was God once.
Why did you bring us here?
Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Do a flip! I'm Santa Claus! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

No argument here.
Negative, bossy meat creature!
When will that be?
Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Fatal.

Large bet on myself in round one. Shut up and take my money! I wish! It's a nickel. When will that be? You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Why not indeed! I love you, buddy! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Also Zoidberg. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… When will that be? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. You can see how I lived before I met you.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. I'll get my kit! And I'm his friend Jesus.

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Bender?! You stole the atom. Now what? Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!
