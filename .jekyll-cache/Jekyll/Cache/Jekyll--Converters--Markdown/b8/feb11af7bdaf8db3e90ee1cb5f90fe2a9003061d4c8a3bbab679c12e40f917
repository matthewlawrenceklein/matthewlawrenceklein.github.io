<p>I don’t think I’m alone in saying that my first foray into software development began when I had an idea for an app that I wanted bad enough
that when I couldn’t find it, I decided to try and learn how to make it myself. A few months later I’ve learned a little enough to know that I know
precious little, but I finally feel like I’m on a path where I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>I’m going to use these blogs as an opportunity to chronicle the process of developing an app <em>alongside</em> developing a skillset</p>
