<p>As we begin moving away from the terminal and into full-fledged web development, we start to examine and work within some Ruby frameworks. First, we touched on Sinatra.

Sinatra is a regular cat - not too smart, not too dumb, knows how to do some stuff, but you’re gonna have to teach it to do most anything useful. I like regular cats. They’re great to play with, and can even provide all sorts of teachable moments! As a first pet…i mean framework, Sinatra/regular cat is a solid jumping off point.

Rails is a lion - big, powerful, intimidating, and definitely not a candidate for your first pet. But, as we maybe (kind of?) learned from the Netflix series Tiger King, those that can harness the power of big cats can accomplish truly great (?) things. Github itself was built on a Rails backend! The first time you runs <code>rails new Project</code></p>
