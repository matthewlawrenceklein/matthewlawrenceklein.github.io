<p>I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m alone in saying that my first foray into software development began when I had an idea for an app that I wanted bad enough
that when I couldnâ€™t find it, I decided to try and learn how to make it myself. A few months later Iâ€™ve learned a little enough to know that I know
precious little, but I finally feel like Iâ€™m on a path where I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to use these blog posts as an opportunity to chronicle the process of developing an app <em>alongside</em> developing a skillset. Letâ€™s go!</p>

<h3 id="chompr---or-idk-what-do-you-feel-like">Chompr - Or, â€œIDK, what do you feel like?â€</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve spent <strong>way</strong> too many nights laying on the couch with a friend or partner doing the back-and-forth dance of â€œwhat are you in the mood to eatâ€. Itâ€™s a vicious cycle of hunger, indecision, and ultimately, the resignation of eventually landing on a choice that no oneâ€™s particularly excited for. Literally any alternative would be prefarable: a giant plinko board, prize wheel, or evenâ€¦ an <strong>app</strong>. Ideally an app that can help its users choose a meal option</p>

<ul>
  <li>easily</li>
  <li>quickly</li>
  <li>intuitively</li>
  <li>fairly, with respect to each chooser</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, Iâ€™ve put together a <em>wish list</em> of features/functionality that Iâ€™d like to pursue, with varying degrees of complexity. Of course, itâ€™s all pretty complex for me right now, but Iâ€™m attemping to tackle it in small chunks. For functionality, Iâ€™m hoping to build out an app that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accepts a geographic location (user-input zipcode? cellular location data? Google web location data?)</li>
  <li>allows for either delivery or take-out</li>
  <li>accepts a number of choosers, with names for each (I think the process starts to break down with 5+ choosers)</li>
  <li>provides the choosers with a randomized set of eight food categories (ie Thai, Korean, BBQ, Pub Fare)</li>
  <li>randomly selects a chooser to select a category to eliminate, within a time limit (30 second?)</li>
  <li>Once choosers have eliminated all but one option, the app instantiates a search for nearby restaurants in that category.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve got some stretch goals too, including user auth and API integration (grubhub? uber eats?). And any mobile development is firmly in the stretch category.</p>

<h3 id="humble-beginnings---lets-write-some-code">Humble Beginnings - Letâ€™s write some code</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve got a couple of big olâ€™ lists of stuff I donâ€™t know how to do yet up there, but I can start buy building some base funcionality. First, letâ€™s figure out a way to randomly generate eight food categories from a much larger â€œdatabaseâ€ of catagories.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def create_choices
    options = %w[Thai Sushi Japanese Southern Korean Greek Armenian Italian Pizza Burgers 
    Sandwiches BBQ Mexican American Fast-Food Diner Chinese Pub-Fare]
    mixed = options.shuffle
    $choice_set = []

    (0...8).map { |i| $choice_set.push(mixed[i]) }
end</code></pre></figure>
