<p>In the giant world of software development, there is truly an awe-inspiring array of options for solving any problem, tackling any project, or building any app. Languages, stacks, design patterns, frameworks, the list goes on! Personally, I’ve found a certain <em>kindred spirit</em> amongst those that abide by the philosophy of “build it first, build it fast, figure out the rest later”. Even though Rails is a deep and thorough framework, the ability to get a rails app scaffolded and running in 20 minutes was revolutionary for web development.</p>

<p>Continuing on in the spirit of the Camping ruby micro-framework, I’ve taken a first look at Kontra.js, a javascript gaming micro-framework. Created for a javascript Game-Jam event where developers were limited to a miniscule file-size, Kontra clocks in at a whopping 14kb. While often used to prototype games, or to get up and running quickly, Kontra’s first commercial release was the Jackbox Games’ “Murder Party”, topping out at over a million units sold. Let’s take a look!</p>

<p>Importing the initialize functipon from the Kontra library allows the game to run and build the game canvas.</p>

<pre><code>import { init } from 'kontra';

let { canvas, context } = init();
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can import the Sprite and Gameloop methods to easily build out a simple sprite and event loop.</p>
