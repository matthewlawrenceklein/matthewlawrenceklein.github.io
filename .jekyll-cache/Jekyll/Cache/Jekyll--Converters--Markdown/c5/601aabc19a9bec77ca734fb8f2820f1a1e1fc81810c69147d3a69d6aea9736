Sinatra is a regular cat - not too smart, not too dumb, knows how to do some stuff, but youâ€™re gonna have to teach it to do most anything useful. I like regular cats. Theyâ€™re great to play with, and can even provide all sorts of teachable moments! As a first petâ€¦i mean framework, Sinatra/regular cat is a solid jumping off point.
