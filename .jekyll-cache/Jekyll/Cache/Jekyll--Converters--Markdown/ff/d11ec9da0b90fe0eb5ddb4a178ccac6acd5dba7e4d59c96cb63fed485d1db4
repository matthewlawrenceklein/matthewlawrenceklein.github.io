<p>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone in saying that my first foray into software development began when I had an idea for an app that I wanted bad enough
that when I couldn‚Äôt find it, I decided to try and learn how to make it myself. A few months later I‚Äôve learned enough to know that I know
precious little, but I finally feel like I‚Äôm on a path where I can see the <em>app</em> at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to use these blog posts as an opportunity to chronicle the process of developing an app <em>alongside</em> developing a skillset. Let‚Äôs go!</p>

<h3 id="chompr---or-idk-what-do-you-feel-like">chompr - Or, ‚ÄúIDK, what do you feel like?‚Äù</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve spent <strong>way</strong> too many nights laying on the couch with a friend or partner doing the back-and-forth dance of ‚Äúwhat are you in the mood to eat‚Äù. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle of hunger, indecision, and ultimately, the resignation of eventually landing on a choice that no one‚Äôs particularly excited for. Literally any alternative would be prefarable: a giant plinko board, prize wheel, or even‚Ä¶ an <strong>app</strong>. Ideally an app that can help its users choose a meal option</p>

<ul>
  <li>easily</li>
  <li>quickly</li>
  <li>intuitively</li>
  <li>fairly, with respect to each chooser</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://rciemecdn.imgix.net/API/Blog/tapas_800px.jpg" alt="lots of food" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>At this point, I‚Äôve put together a <em>wish list</em> of features/functionality that I‚Äôd like to pursue, with varying degrees of complexity. Of course, it‚Äôs all pretty complex for me right now, but I‚Äôm attemping to tackle it in small chunks. For functionality, I‚Äôm hoping to build out an app that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accepts a geographic location (user-input zipcode? cellular location data? Google web location data?)</li>
  <li>allows for either delivery or take-out</li>
  <li>accepts a number of choosers, with names for each (I think the process starts to break down with 5+ choosers)</li>
  <li>provides the choosers with a randomized set of eight food categories (ie Thai, Korean, BBQ, Pub Fare)</li>
  <li>randomly selects a chooser to select a category to eliminate, within a time limit (30 second?)</li>
  <li>Once choosers have eliminated all but one option, the app instantiates a search for nearby restaurants in that category.</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve got some stretch goals too, including user auth and API integration (grubhub? uber eats?). And any mobile development is firmly in the stretch category.</p>

<h3 id="humble-beginnings---lets-write-some-code">Humble Beginnings - Let‚Äôs write some code</h3>

<p>I‚Äôve got a couple of big ol‚Äô lists of stuff I don‚Äôt know how to do yet up there, but I can start by building some base functionality. First, let‚Äôs figure out a way to randomly generate eight food categories from a much larger ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù of catagories.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def create_choices
    options = %w[Thai Sushi Japanese Southern Korean Greek Armenian Italian Pizza Burgers 
    Sandwiches BBQ Mexican American Fast-Food Diner Chinese Pub-Fare]
    
    mixed = options.shuffle
    
    $choice_set = []

    (0...8).map { |i| $choice_set.push(mixed[i]) }
end</code></pre></figure>

<p>Cool, so now we‚Äôve got the ability to grab a new and randomized choice set every time. Now we should try and grab the number of chompers, and allow for naming each of them. Again, we‚Äôll probably want to keep the max chompers to 4.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def get_users
        print &quot;&gt; &quot;
        $users = $stdin.gets.chomp 

        case 
        when $users.to_i &lt;= 4
            puts &quot;~&quot; * 15
            puts &quot;super&quot;
        when $users.to_i &gt; 4
            puts &quot;~&quot; * 15
            puts &quot;too many folx&quot;
            get_users()
        else
            puts &quot;~&quot; * 15
            puts &quot;invalid input&quot;
            get_users()
        end
        puts &quot;~&quot; * 15
    end</code></pre></figure>

<p>And let‚Äôs get names for each chomper</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def name_users

        $user_array = []
        i = 0
    
        while i &lt; $users.to_i do
            print &quot;user #{i + 1} name &gt; &quot;
            $user_array[i] = $stdin.gets.chomp
            i += 1
        end

``
        puts &quot;super, we&#39;ve got&quot;
        puts &quot;~&quot; * 15
        puts $user_array
        puts &quot;~&quot; * 15
    end</code></pre></figure>

<p>Finally, let‚Äôs layout the logic for each elimination round. We want to</p>
<ul>
  <li>randomly select a chomper to make a selection</li>
  <li>show the chomper the current food options</li>
  <li>take input for the option they‚Äôd like to eliminate</li>
  <li>remove the option from the options set</li>
  <li>repeat until one option remains</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got so far</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def elimination_round
    
        while $choice_set.length &gt; 1
            shuffled_users = $user_array.shuffle()
            puts &quot;#{shuffled_users[0]}, you&#39;ve been selected to eliminate an option&quot;
            puts &quot;what would you like to eliminate?&quot;
            print &quot;&gt; &quot;
            eliminate = $stdin.gets.chomp

            $choice_set.each do |name|
                if name == eliminate
                    $choice_set.delete(name)
                end
            end

            puts &quot;your options are now&quot;
            puts &quot;~&quot; * 15
            puts $choice_set
            puts &quot;~&quot; * 15
        end
    end</code></pre></figure>

<p>Excellent! Now we‚Äôre making progress!

<p>We‚Äôve not got the basic logic functioning, and we‚Äôre set to take user input from the command line. My next step is going to be packaging this functionality into a 
CLI ruby gem, and <em>shipping</em> a first <em>completed</em> product - so to speak. C‚Äôyall in a few weeks!</p>
