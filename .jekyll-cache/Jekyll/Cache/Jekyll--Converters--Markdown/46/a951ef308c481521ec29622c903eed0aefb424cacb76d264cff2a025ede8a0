<p>I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m alone in saying that my first foray into software development began when I had an idea for an app that I wanted bad enough
that when I couldnâ€™t find it, I decided to try and learn how to make it myself. A few months later Iâ€™ve learned a little enough to know that I know
precious little, but I finally feel like Iâ€™m on a path where I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to use these blog posts as an opportunity to chronicle the process of developing an app <em>alongside</em> developing a skillset. Letâ€™s go!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve spent <strong>way</strong> too many nights laying on the couch with a friend or partner doing the back-and-forth dance of â€œwhat are you in the mood to eatâ€. Itâ€™s a vicious cycle of hunger, indecision, and ultimately, the resignation of eventually landing on a choice that no oneâ€™s particularly excited for.</p>
